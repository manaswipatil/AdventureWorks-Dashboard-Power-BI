# AdventureWorks-Dashboard-Power-BI

***The Brief :***

 **AdventureWorks** is a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories. The management team needs a way to **track KPIs** (sales, revenue, profit, returns), **compare regional performance**, **analyze product-level trends**, and **identify high-value customers**.
All youâ€™ve been given is a folder of **raw csv files**, which contain information about transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories.

***What I learned:***

- The data was provided in csv format files for customer, product categories, territory data, sales data, and returns.
The data was checked and cleaned for duplicates, error and tranformations were performed to create calculated columns and measures with common functions and formulas.
- Build a relational data model, creating active relations between tables and understanding cardinality and filter flow.
- Designed an interactive dashboard to visualize data using charts and visuals:
KPI cards, Matrix, Slicers, Bar chart, Line and clustered column chart, Gauge, Map etc.
- Created Bookmarks, drill-through filters and page level, report level filters.
